## Development of a PDF-Based Question-Answering Chatbot Using LangChain
## AIM:
To design and implement a question-answering chatbot capable of processing and extracting information from a provided PDF document using LangChain, and to evaluate its effectiveness by testing its responses to diverse queries derived from the document's content.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In many cases, users need specific information from large documents without manually searching through them. A question-answering chatbot can address this problem by:

Parsing and indexing the content of a PDF document.
Allowing users to ask questions in natural language.
Providing concise and accurate answers based on the content of the document.
The implementation will evaluate the chatbotâ€™s ability to handle diverse queries and deliver accurate responses.

## DESIGN STEPS:
## STEP 1: Load and Parse PDF
Use LangChain's DocumentLoader to extract text from a PDF document.

## STEP 2: Create a Vector Store
Convert the text into vector embeddings using a language model, enabling semantic search.

## STEP 3: Initialize the LangChain QA Pipeline
Use LangChain's RetrievalQA to connect the vector store with a language model for answering questions.

## STEP 4: Handle User Queries
Process user queries, retrieve relevant document sections, and generate responses.

## STEP 5: Evaluate Effectiveness
Test the chatbot with a variety of queries to assess accuracy and reliability.

from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import DocArrayInMemorySearch
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA,  ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

def load_db(file, chain_type, k):
    # load documents
    loader = PyPDFLoader(file)
    documents = loader.load()

    # split documents
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=150)
    docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

    # define embedding
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

    # create vector database from data
    db = DocArrayInMemorySearch.from_documents(docs, embeddings)

    # define retriever
    retriever = db.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": k})

    # create a chatbot chain. Memory is managed externally.
    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model_name=llm_name, temperature=0), 
        chain_type=chain_type, 
        retriever=retriever, 
        return_source_documents=True,
        return_generated_question=True,
    )
    return qa 
## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
Thus, a question-answering chatbot capable of processing and extracting information from a provided PDF document using LangChain was implemented and evaluated for its effectiveness by testing its responses to diverse queries derived from the document's content successfully.
